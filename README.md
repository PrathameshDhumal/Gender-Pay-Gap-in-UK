Key Findings

Pay Quartile Imbalance: Men disproportionately occupy higher salary quartiles.

Sector Gaps: Industries such as education, construction, technical roles, science, and finance exhibit the largest pay gaps.

Predictors of Pay Gap: A company’s lower and top pay quartiles are strong indicators of pay disparity, while overall company size has minimal impact.
